### It's time to think differently about how we measure content. 

Content creation has become a respected fixture in the business world at last. Numbers show that nearly every industry is relying on content marketing to build brands and engage customers.[^1] 

But the sole metrics that can be studied are what happens to content after it's displayed -- How many clicks did it get? How many retweets? 

That's like measuring sales of your widget without measuring how much they cost to build. Studying half of a process doesn't create real insight. 

At Beegit we're looking to answer one burning question: How do you measure what went into content creation? 

Content professionals have been trying to get their arms around what's happening in their creation workflow for a while now, but the right solution hasn't existed. Many are using project management tools like Trello to track processes, but that just shows people moving work from one queue to another. Others are using time tracking applications like Harvest and Tsheets, but those often require manual effort and they don't give the context of output over that time.

Our take is a little different. With our upcoming release of [Beegit](https://beegit.com), we are introducing content creation metrics. What does that mean? We are taking writing and editing sessions inside our system and putting context around them, showing what people worked on, how much time they spent and how many words they added and deleted. Creativity is difficult to measure, but relevant data on who did what helps make sense of what happens in a writing project.

Here's a quick look at the analytics interface.

### Better metrics for individual writers 

For individual content creators, we want to show you how you're spending your time. This will let you measure one project versus another to see how long each one took. 

If you're an author, it helps you set writing goals and lets you see productivity over time to find out when you're most productive. 

If you're a freelancer, these numbers let you measure client projects and see where you're spending your time. It also gives metrics to justify your cost. For the first time, you can show your clients how long a great piece of content really takes. 

### More productive data for content teams 

For content teams, the metrics give you data across one project and across historical projects. Mixed with our [version control solution](http://blog.beegit.com/2014/06/09/real-version-control/), you can more clearly measure how your team put together the pieces of a content project.

For your client work, it means you don't have to defend the time spent during the content creation process. They can see how much time went into a project. And, if they contributed to the content and you altered it, they can see what you added and deleted and how long those revisions took. 

When you have the context of who did what, plus the ability to sort content data by what individuals contributed, you'll have new insight on your business. 

Here's a sneak peek at some project data sorted by what individual users contributed.
