We have something cool to share today. 

We've released a feature unlike anything that exists in the content world: **Metrics for content development**. 

[Sign in to Beegit or sign up](https://beegit.com/login) now to see how we've added automated time tracking and basic creation analytics to your Beegit writing sessions.

These metrics are available inside your projects and will start calculating on all your writing from today going forward. So [sign in](https://beegit.com/login), create a new project and start creating some analytics! 

This is another step in making Beegit a centralized hub for your content creation. We've had great feedback from users during our beta, so try out this new feature and tell us what you think by sending us an [email](mailto:support@beegit.com) or using the feedback form inside the system when you're logged in.
