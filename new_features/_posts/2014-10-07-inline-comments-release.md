We hope you're enjoying Beegit's closed beta release. We're certainly loving every minute of it as we push toward our public launch! 

The feedback from our users has been great, and today we're happy to release one of our most requested features: inline commenting. 

[Sign in or sign up](https://beegit.com/login) now and see how easy it is to tie comments to selected text to make collaboration in Beegit even easier. 

That's what's new at Beegit, and there are more requested features coming soon. Have an idea for a feature or a question about the software? Shoot us an [email](mailto:support@beegit.com) with your thoughts.
